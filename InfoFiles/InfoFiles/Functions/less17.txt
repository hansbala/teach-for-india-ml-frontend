Okay! Let's review functions.

	def speak(message):
    	    return message

	if happy():
    	    speak("I'm happy!")
	elif sad():
    	    speak("I'm sad.")
	else:
    	    speak("I don't know what I'm feeling.")

Again, the example code above is just there for your reference!


INSTRUCTIONS:

1. First, def a function, shut_down, that takes one argument s. Don't forget the parentheses or the colon!

2. Then, if the shut_down function receives an s equal to "yes", it should return "Shutting down"

3. Alternatively, elif s is equal to "no", then the function should return "Shutdown aborted".

4. Finally, if shut_down gets anything other than those inputs, the function should return "Sorry"
