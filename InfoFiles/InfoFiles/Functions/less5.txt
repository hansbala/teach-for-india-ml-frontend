		FUNCTIONS CALLING FUNCTIONS

We've seen functions that can print text or do simple arithmetic, but functions can be much more powerful than that. For example, a function can call another function:

	def fun_one(n):
    	    return n * 5

	def fun_two(m):
    	    return fun_one(m) + 7


INSTRUCTIONS:

Let's look at the two functions in the editor: one_good_turn (which adds 1 to the number it takes in as an argument) and deserves_another (which adds 2).

Change the body of deserves_another so that it always adds 2 to the output of one_good_turn.
