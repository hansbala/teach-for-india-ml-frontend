		TYPE()

Finally, the type() function returns the type of the data it receives as an argument. If you ask Python to do the following:

	print type(42)
	print type(4.2)
	print type('spam')

Python will output:

	<type 'int'>
	<type 'float'>
	<type 'str'>


INSTRUCTIONS:

Have Python print out the type of an int, a float, and a str string in the editor. You can pick any values on which to call type(), so long as they produce one of each.
