		FUNCTIONS

You might have considered the situation where you would like to reuse a piece of code, just with a few different values. Instead of rewriting the whole code, it's much cleaner to define a function, which can then be used repeatedly.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Check out the code in the editor.
Here you can see we've defined two functions: tax to calculate the tax on a bill, and tip to compute the tip.
See how much of the code you understand at first glance (we'll explain it all soon). When you're ready, click EXECUTE to continue.
