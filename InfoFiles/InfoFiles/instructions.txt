		INSTRUCTIONS

Before we start learning, you need to know a little about how this application works.

On the left (where you are reading this information), is called the Information window. It is where you will receive instructions on how to code.

The window to your right is called the Editor window. It is where you can type your programs and run them to see how your are faring.

To run any program you type in, click on the 'EXECUTE' button on the bottom right hand corner.

If you can't seem to solve a exercise on a given page, feel free to hit the 'SHOW ANSWER' button. We are all here to learn :)

If you want to clear the editor window, you guessed it, just hit the 'RESET' button.

That is all you need to know right now. 
LETS GET STARTED ON CODING!
