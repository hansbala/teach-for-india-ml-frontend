		MULTI LINE COMMENTS

The # sign will only comment out a single line. While you could write a multi-line comment, starting each line with #, that can be a pain.

Instead, for multi-line comments, you can include the whole block in a set of triple quotation marks:

	"""Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over,
	Holy Grail.
	"""

INSTRUCTIONS:
Write a multi-line comment in the editor. It can be any text you'd like!
