		BOOLEANS

Great! You just stored a number in a variable. Numbers are one data type we use in programming. A second data type is called a boolean.

A boolean is like a light switch. It can only have two values. Just like a light switch can only be on or off, a boolean can only be True or False.

You can use variables to store booleans like this:

	a = True
	b = False

INSTRUCTIONS:
Set the following variables to the corresponding values:

1. my_int to the value 7
2. my_float to the value 1.23
3. my_bool to the value True
