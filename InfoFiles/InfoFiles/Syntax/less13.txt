		ALL TOGETHER

Nice work! So far, you've learned about:

--> Variables, which store values for later use

--> Data types, such as numbers and booleans

--> Whitespace, which separates statements

--> Comments, which make your code easier to read

--> Arithmetic operations, including +, -, *, /, **, and %

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Write a single-line comment on line 1. It can be anything! (Make sure it starts with #)
2. Set the variable monty equal to True.
3. Set another variable python equal to 1.234.
4. Set a third variable monty_python equal to python squared.
