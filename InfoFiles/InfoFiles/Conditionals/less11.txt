		CONDITIONAL SYNTAX

if is a conditional statement that executes some specified code after checking if its expression is True.

Here's an example of if statement syntax:

	if 8 < 9:
    	    print "Eight is less than nine!"

In this example, 8 < 9 is the checked expression and print "Eight is less than nine!" is the specified code.

INSTRUCTIONS:

If you think the print statement will print to the console, set response equal to 'Y'; otherwise, set response equal to 'N'.
