		SWITCH

"Elif" is short for "else if." It means exactly what it sounds like: "otherwise, if the following expression is true, do this!"

	if 8 > 9:
    	    print "I don't get printed!"
	elif 8 < 9:
    	    print "I get printed!"
	else:
    	    print "I also don't get printed!"

In the example above, the elif statement is only checked if the original if statement if False.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. On line 2, fill in the if statement to check if answer is greater than 5.

2. On line 4, fill in the elif so that the function outputs -1 if answer is less than 5.
