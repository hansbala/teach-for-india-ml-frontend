		AND/OR/NOT

Boolean operators compare statements and result in boolean values. There are three boolean operators:

1. and, which checks if both the statements are True;
2. or, which checks if at least one of the statements is True;
3. not, which gives the opposite of the statement.

We'll go through the operators one by one.
