		EXERCISE

Really great work! Here's what you've learned in this unit:

Comparators:

3 < 4
5 >= 5
10 == 10
12 != 13

Boolean operators:

True or False 
(3 < 4) and (5 >= 5)
this() and not that()

Conditional statements:

	if this_might_be_true():
	    print "This really is true."
	elif that_might_be_true():
	    print "That is true."
	else:
    	   print "None of the above."


Let's get to the grand finale.


INSTRUCTIONS:


Write an if statement in the_flying_circus(). It must include:

1. if, elif, and else statements;
2. At least one of and, or, or not;
3. A comparator (==, !=, <, <=, >, or >=);
4. Finally, the_flying_circus() must return True when evaluated.

Don't forget to include a : after your if statements!
