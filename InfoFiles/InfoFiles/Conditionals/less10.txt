		MIX 'N' MATCH

Great work! We're almost done with boolean operators.

	# Make me false
	bool_one = (2 <= 2) and "Alpha" == "Bravo"

INSTRUCTIONS:

This time we'll give the expected result, and you'll use some combination of boolean operators to achieve that result.

Remember, the boolean operators are and, or, and not. Use each one at least once!
