		TURNED TABLES

Comparisons result in either True or False, which are booleans as we learned before.

	# Make me true!
	bool_one = 3 < 5

Let's switch it up: we'll give the boolean, and you'll write the expression, just like the example above.

INSTRUCTIONS:

For each boolean value in the editor, write an expression that evaluates to that value.

Remember, comparators are: ==, !=, >, >=, <, and <=.

Use at least three different ones!

Don't just use True and False! That's cheating!
