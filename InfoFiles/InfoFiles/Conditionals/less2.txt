		COMPARE I

Let's start with the simplest aspect of control flow: comparators. There are six:

1. Equal to (==)
2. Not equal to (!=)
3. Less than (<)
4. Less than or equal to (<=)
5. Greater than (>)
6. Greater than or equal to (>=)
7. Comparators check if a value is (or is not) equal to, greater than (or 8. equal to), or less than (or equal to) another value.

Note that == compares whether two things are equal, and = assigns a value to a variable.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Set each variable to True or False depending on what you think the result will be. For example, 1 < 2 will be True, because one is less than two.

1. Set bool_one equal to the result of 17 < 328
2. Set bool_two equal to the result of 100 == (2 * 50)
3. Set bool_three equal to the result of 19 <= 19
4. Set bool_four equal to the result of -22 >= -18
5. Set bool_five equal to the result of 99 != (98 + 1)
