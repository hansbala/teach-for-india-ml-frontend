		ELSE

The else statement complements the if statement. An if/else pair says: "If this expression is true, run this indented code block; otherwise, run this code after the else statement."

Unlike if, else doesn't depend on an expression. For example:

	if 8 > 9:
   	    print "I don't printed!"
	else:
    	    print "I get printed!"

INSTRUCTIONS:

Complete the else statements to the right. Note the indentation for each line!
