		ACCESS BY INDEX

Great work!

Each character in a string is assigned a number. This number is called the index. Check out the diagram in the editor.

	c = "cats"[0]
	n = "Ryan"[3]

1. In the above example, we create a new variable called c and set it to "c", the character at index zero of the string "cats".

2. Next, we create a new variable called n and set it to "n", the character at index three of the string "Ryan".

In Python, we start counting the index from zero instead of one.

INSTRUCTIONS:
On line 13, assign the variable fifth_letter equal to the fifth letter of the string "MONTY".

Remember that the fifth letter is not at index 5. Start counting your indices from zero.
