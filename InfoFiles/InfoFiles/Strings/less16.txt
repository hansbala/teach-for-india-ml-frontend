		STRING EXERCISE

Great job! You've learned a lot in this unit, including:

Three ways to create strings

	'Alpha'
	"Bravo"
	str(3)

String methods:
	
	len("Charlie")
	"Delta".upper()
	"Echo".lower()

Printing a string:

	print "Foxtrot"

Advanced printing techniques:

	g = "Golf"
	h = "Hotel"
	print "%s, %s" % (g, h)

INSTRUCTIONS:

Let's wrap it all up!

1. On line 3, create the variable my_string and set it to any string you'd like.

2. On line 4, print the length of my_string.

3. On line 5, print the .upper() case version of my_string.
