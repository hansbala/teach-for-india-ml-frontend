		FORMATTING II

Remember, we used the % operator to replace the %s placeholders with the variables in parentheses.

	name = "Mike"
	print "Hello %s" % (name)

You need the same number of %s terms in a string as the number of variables in parentheses:

	print "The %s who %s %s!" % ("Knights", "say", "Ni")
	# This will print "The Knights who say Ni!"

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Inside the string, replace the three ___ with %s.

2. After the string but before the three variables, replace the final ___ with a %.
3. Hit EXECUTE.

4. Answer the questions in the console as they pop up! Type in your answer and hit Enter.
