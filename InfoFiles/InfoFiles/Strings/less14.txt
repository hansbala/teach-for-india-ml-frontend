		FORMATTING I

When you want to print a variable with a string, there is a better method than concatenating strings together.

	name = "Mike"
	print "Hello %s" % (name)

The % operator after a string is used to combine a string with variables. The % operator will replace a %s in the string with the string variable that comes after it.
