		STRING CONVERSION (EXPLICIT)

Sometimes you need to combine a string with something that isn't a string. In order to do that, you have to convert the non-string into a string.

	print "I have " + str(2) + " coconuts!"

This will print I have 2 coconuts!.

The str() method converts non-strings into strings. In the above example, you convert the number 2 into a string and then you concatenate the strings together just like in the previous exercise.

Now try it yourself!

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Run the code as-is. You get an error!

2. Use str() to turn 3.14 into a string. Then run the code again.
