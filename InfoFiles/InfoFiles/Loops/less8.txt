		PRACTISE WHILE-ELSE

Now you should be able to make a game similar to the one in the last exercise. The code from the last exercise is below:

	count = 0
	while count < 3:
    	    num = random.randint(1, 6)
    	    print num
    	    if num == 5:
                print "Sorry, you lose!"
                break
    	    count += 1
	else:
    	    print "You win!"

In this exercise, allow the user to guess what the number is three times.

	guess = int(raw_input("Your guess: "))

Remember, raw_input turns user input into a string, so we use int() to make it a number again.


INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Use a while loop to let the user keep guessing so long as guesses_left is greater than zero.

2. Ask the user for their guess, just like the second example above.

3. If they guess correctly, print 'You win!' and break.

4. Decrement guesses_left by one.

5. Use an else: case after your while loop to print 'You lose.'.
