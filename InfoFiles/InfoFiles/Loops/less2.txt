		CONDITION

The condition is the expression that decides whether the loop is going to be executed or not. There are 5 steps to this program:

1. The loop_condition variable is set to True

2. The while loop checks to see if loop_condition is True. It is, so the loop is entered.

3. The print statement is executed.

4. The variable loop_condition is set to False.

5. The while loop again checks to see if loop_condition is True. It is not, so the loop is not executed a second time.


INSTRUCTIONS:

See how the loop checks its condition, and when it stops executing? When you think you've got the hang of it, click EXECUTE to continue.
