		MODULO

Our final operator is modulo. Modulo returns the remainder from a division. So, if you type 3 % 2, it will return 1, because 2 goes into 3 evenly once, with 1 left over.

EXERCISE:
1. Use modulo to set 'spam' equal to 1. You can use any two numbers that will leave a remainder of 1 to do this.
2. Print 'spam' to the console.

(Hint: Try 5 % 4.)
