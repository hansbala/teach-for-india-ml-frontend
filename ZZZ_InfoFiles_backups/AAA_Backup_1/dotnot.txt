		DOT NOTATION

Let's take a closer look at why you use len(string) and str(object), but dot notation (such as "String".upper()) for the rest.

	lion = "roar"
	len(lion)
	lion.upper()

Methods that use dot notation only work with strings.

On the other hand, len() and str() can work on other data types.

EXERCISE:
1. Declare a variable called ministry and set it equal to:
	
	ministry = "The Ministry of Silly Walks"

2. Print the len() of the variable ministry.
3. Also print the variable ministry entirely in UPPERCASE.
