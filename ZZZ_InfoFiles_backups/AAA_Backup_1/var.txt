		VARIABLES

Creating web apps, games, and search engines all involve storing and working with different types of data. They do so using variables. A variable stores a piece of data, and gives it a specific name.

For example:
	spam = 5

The variable spam now stores the number 5.

EXERCISE:
Type in the following code and click on the save & run on the bottom right hand corner to see how it works:

	my_age = 17
	print my_age

EXPLANATION:
This sets the variable my_age to the value 17. On the following line it prints this value.
