		STRINGS

Another useful data type is the string. A string can contain letters, numbers, and symbols.

	name = "Ryan"
	age = "19"
	food = "cheese"

1. In the above example, we create a variable name and set it to the string value "Ryan".
2. We also set age to "19" and food to "cheese".

IMPORTANT: 
1. Strings need to be within quotes.
2. Quotes can be either single quotes like:
	
	exam = 'Physics'

or double quotes like:

	exam = "Physics"

They are mostly interchangeable but you will see further on that in some cases one is preferred over the other.

EXERCISE:
1. Create a new variable brian and assign it the string "Hello life!".
