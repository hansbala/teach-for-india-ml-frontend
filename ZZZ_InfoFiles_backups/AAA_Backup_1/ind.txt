		INDEXATION

Great work!

Each character in a string is assigned a number. This number is called the index. Check out the following diagram.

The string "PYTHON" has six characters,
numbered 0 to 5, as shown below:

| P | Y | T | H | O | N |
  0   1   2    3    4   5

So if you wanted "Y", you could just type
"PYTHON"[1] (always start counting from 0!)

	c = "cats"[0]
	n = "Ryan"[3]

1. In the above example, we create a new variable called c and set it to "c", the character at index zero of the string "cats".
2. Next, we create a new variable called n and set it to "n", the character at index three of the string "Ryan".

In Python, we start counting the index from zero instead of one.

EXERCISE:
1. Assign the variable 'fifth_letter' equal to the fifth letter of the string "MONTY".
2. Print 'fifth_letter' to the console.

Remember that the fifth letter is not at index 5. Start counting your indices from zero.
