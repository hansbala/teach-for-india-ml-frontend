		EXPONENTIATION

All that math can be done on a calculator, so why use Python? Because you can combine math with other data types (e.g. booleans) and commands to create useful programs. Calculators just stick to numbers.

Now let's work with exponents (or powers of a number).
Consider the following code:
	
	eight = 2 ** 3

In the above example, we create a new variable called eight and set it to 8, or the result of 2 to the power to 3 (2^3).

Notice that we use ** instead of * or the multiplication operator.

EXERCISE:
1. Create a new variable called 'eggs' and use exponents to set eggs equal 100.
   (Try raising 10 to the power of 2.)
2. Print eggs to the console.
