		UPPER()

Now your string is 100% lower case! A similar method exists to make a string completely upper case.

EXERCISE:
1. Type the following code into the editor to see what it returns:

	parrot = "Norwegian BLUE"
	print parrot.upper()

2. If all goes well, it should print "NORWEGIAN BLUE".
