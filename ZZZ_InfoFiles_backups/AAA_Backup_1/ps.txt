		PRINTING STRINGS

If you didn't know already, the area where we've been writing our code is called the editor.

The console (the window that appears when you run the program) is where the results of your code is shown.

print simply displays your code in the console.

EXERCISE:
1. Print "Monty Python" to the console.
