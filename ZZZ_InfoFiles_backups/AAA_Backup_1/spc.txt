		WHITESPACE

In Python, whitespace is used to structure code. Whitespace is important, so you have to be careful with how you use it.

Another important concept is that of indentation. If you don't know what indentation is, it is quite simply how you structure your code.

Consider the following snippet of code:
1	def main():
2	    print "How are you all doing today?"

We call the spaces that come before the print statement on Line 2 INDENTATION. Without proper indentation, your python program will fail to run. Make sure when declaring loops, functions(discussed in later chapters), or really any nested body to include a tab or at least 4 spaces (these are interchangeable).

If you fail to indent your code you will receive the following error:
	IndentationError: expected an indented block

Be on the lookout for such errors.
