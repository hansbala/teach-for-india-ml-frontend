		COMMENTS

I. Single Line Comments:
   --------------------------

You probably saw us use the # sign a few times in earlier exercises. The # sign is for comments. A comment is a line of text that Python won't try to run as code. It's just for humans to read.

Comments make your program easier to understand. When you look back at your code or others want to collaborate with you, they can read your comments and easily figure out what your code does.

EXERCISE 1:
Write a comment on line 1. Make sure it starts with #. It can say anything you like.


II. Multi-Line Comments:
    --------------------------

The # sign will only comment out a single line. While you could write a multi-line comment, starting each line with #, that can be a pain.

Instead, for multi-line comments, you can include the whole block in a set of triple quotation marks like the following example:

	"""Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over,
	Holy Grail.
	"""
EXERCISE 2:
Write a multi-line comment in the editor. It can be any text you'd like!
