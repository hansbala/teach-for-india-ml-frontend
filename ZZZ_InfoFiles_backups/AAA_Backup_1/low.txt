		STRING METHODS

Great work! Now that we know how to store strings, let's see how we can change them using string methods.

String methods let you perform specific tasks for strings.

We'll focus on four string methods:

1. len()
2. lower()
3. upper()
4. str()


I. Let's start with len(), which gets the length (the number of characters) of a string!

EXERCISE 1:
In the editor try to mimic the following code:

	parrot = "Norwegian Blue"
	print len(parrot)

The output would be the number of letters in "Norwegian Blue".

II. CONVERTING TO LOWERCASE:

You can use the lower() method to get rid of all the capitalization in your strings. You call lower() like so:

	"Ryan".lower()

which will return "ryan".

EXERCISE:
1. Type the following code into the editor to see what it returns:

	parrot = "Norwegian BLUE"
	print parrot.lower()

2. If all goes well, it should print "norwegian blue".
