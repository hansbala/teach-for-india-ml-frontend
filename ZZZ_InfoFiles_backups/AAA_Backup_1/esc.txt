		ESCAPING CHARACTERS

There are some characters that cause problems. For example:

	'There's a snake in my boot!'

This code breaks because Python thinks the apostrophe in 'There's' ends the string. We can use the backslash to fix the problem, like this:

	'There\'s a snake in my boot!'

EXERCISE:
1. Try to set the following string to a variable named 'spam'.

	Jasmine told Rehu, "Stop misbehaving."

2. Print the variable spam.
